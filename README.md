### 3. Key Requirements for Smooth Vercel Deployment

#### 3.1. Git Integration and Workflow

* Enable Git integration via Vercel.
* Set up auto-assign for custom domains.
* Use GitHub Actions for deployment gating.

#### 3.2. Supported Frameworks and Runtimes

* Compatible with Next.js, Astro, Vue, Nuxt, etc.
* Supports Node.js (20.x/22.x), Python (e.g., 3.12).
* Lock files dictate package manager usage (npm, Yarn, pnpm, Bun).

#### 3.3. Configuration Settings

* Define a build script in `package.json`.
* Avoid mixing `routes` with rewrites or headers in `vercel.json`.
* Use `vercel.json` to specify `outputDirectory`, functions, and regions.
* Stay within env var limits (100 vars max, 65536 characters max per value).

#### 3.4. Recommended Coding Practices

* Modularize code for clarity and performance.
* Split large components (avoid 2000+ line files).
* Use efficient bundlers and lazy loading.
* For AI-assisted tools (e.g., v0), ensure high-quality prompt design.

### 4. Conclusion: Best Practices for Continuous Deployment Success

* Prioritize local parity (`vercel build` locally).
* Monitor Vercel logs for precise error detection.
* Keep dependencies, configurations, and environments in sync.
* Leverage Vercel documentation and community for support.
* Embrace a structured, proactive deployment approach.
